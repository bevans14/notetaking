module system 
node provides alot  of modules
async vs sync node
takes two arguments name of file and data want to write

require function is how we load in things such as module

require function returns all stuff from module
!! you need to store it in a variable !!

so const fs = require('fs')

fs.writeFileSync('notes.txt', 'My name is brooke.')

!! writefile and writefilesync methods write data to a file !!
!! if file doesnt exist it will be created !!
!! if  file exists text content will be overwritten !!

variable needs to be same before .writeFileSync

challenge : append a message to notes.txt importing core modules 13:00

when pass file to node only that file executes
!!!!!!!!!!
!! all files have its own scope
!! how to access those files
!!!!!!! intentionally export all stuff  the file needs to share with outside world
!! modules system module.exports
